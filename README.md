# R A L P H — Loop Infinite

### Self-Improving AI Systems Without the Chaos

---

## Overview

Ralph-Loop-Infinite is a production-grade autonomous AI system built on enforced structure — not wishful prompts hoping to behave. It is an infinite verifier-gate framework inspired by the Ralph Loop architecture from [gowrishankar.info](https://gowrishankar.info/blog/ralph-loop-building-self-improving-ai-systems-without-claude/), with a bounded explicit engine inside the gate (`GENERATE → CRITIQUE → JUDGE → REMEDIATE`) and an additional HMAC-signed PASS requirement for operational safety.

**Three roles, precisely defined:**

| Role | Function | Stops the loop? |
|---|---|---|
| **GENERATOR** | Produces output. Repeats until JUDGE PASS. | Never |
| **CRITIC** | Identifies concrete issues. Shapes next GENERATOR iteration. | No |
| **JUDGE** | Scores 5 dimensions. Issues HMAC-signed PASS. | Only via PASS |

## Installation

### One-Command Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Victordtesla24/ralph-loop-infinite.git
cd ralph-loop-infinite
bash bootstrap.sh
```

### What Bootstrap Does

```
[1/6] Installing Ralph hooks to ~/.claude/hooks/
[2/6] Generating HMAC signing key (~/.claude/secrets/ralph-hmac.key)
[3/6] Registering contract hashes (~/.claude/manifest/contract-hashes.json)
[4/6] Creating state directory (~/.claude/state/)
[5/6] Initializing SQLite database
[6/6] Running self-test (PASS 26 / FAIL 0)
```

### Runtime Dependencies

- `python3`, `bash`, and `jq` are required for hook enforcement, evidence checks, and JSON signing paths.
- The optional sub-agent fan-out path uses the Claude CLI binary from `RALPH_SPAWN_CLAUDE_CMD` or `claude` on `PATH`.
- If the Claude CLI is absent (common in CI), the Stop hook logs `CLAUDE_CLI_MISSING` and downgrades generator retry to the repository-local inline `RalphLoopEngine.generate(...)` path instead of silently failing the whole loop.

### Post-Install Configuration

Copy API keys to `~/.claude/.env.production`:

```bash
cat >> ~/.claude/.env.production << 'EOF'
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
ANTHROPIC_VERIFIER_API_KEY=your-anthropic-verifier-key-here
RALPH_HMAC_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 64)
EOF
```

> HMAC key is auto-generated. The `RALPH_HMAC_KEY` above is only for the signing mechanism — the actual HMAC key is stored at `~/.claude/secrets/ralph-hmac.key` and never printed.

---

## How to Use

### Arm the Loop

```
/ralph-loop-infinite
```

The loop activates **only** on explicit invocation. Ship/deploy/done language does NOT arm the gate.

### Monitor State

```bash
# View sessions
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/ralph-loop-infinite-db.py sessions

# View current state
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/ralph-loop-infinite-db.py state-get verifier_last_verdict

# View event log
python3 ~/.claude/hooks/ralph-loop-infinite-db.py events

# Run regression harness
bash ~/.claude/hooks/test-ralph-refactor.sh
```

### Disarm (Manual Exit — Only With User Reason)

```
/ralph-loop-infinite-disarm — I want to stop this loop now and continue manually
```

Requires ≥ 10 character reason. Agent cannot self-disarm.

---

## Architecture

### The Four Stages

```
GENERATE → CRITIQUE → JUDGE → REMEDIATE → (repeat until JUDGE PASS)
```

**Generate:** First-class `Generated` typed object owned by `hooks/ralph-loop-infinite-ralph.py` (`RalphLoopEngine.generate()`). The optional `ralph-loop-infinite-generator.py` sidecar is an executor backend that returns typed role artifacts; hooks adapt to the engine, they do not own the loop.

**Critique:** Concrete issues with severity (1-5) and actionable suggestions. NOT vague feedback.

**Judge:** Scores all five dimensions (completeness, correctness, clarity, depth, actionability) — each 0.0-1.0. Any dimension < 0.80 → automatic revise. No partial credit, no averaging.

> **Implementation note:** The JUDGE role is fulfilled by the `ralph-loop-infinite-verifier.sh` shell script, which invokes the `judge` subcommand of `ralph-loop-infinite-ralph.py`. This is a Python-based judge that calls a model API (Anthropic/DeepSeek/MiniMax/GLM) with a structured system prompt, parses the response into typed `Critique` + `Judgement` objects, and enforces per-dimension threshold and anti-leniency rules programmatically. It is **not** a separately spawned sub-agent with its own conversation context — the `verifier.SOUL.md` prompt file documents the role contract but the actual judging is performed inline by the Python engine operating on the full evidence bundle.

**Remediate:** Targeted fix — preserve correct parts, address only identified issues. NOT a naive full rewrite. The blog says: *"treat this like an editor with a red pen, NOT a writer."*

### Exit Conditions

```
HMAC-SIGNED PASS              MAX_ITERATIONS (default: 3)      CONVERGENCE
all 5 dims ≥ 0.80            → best-iteration output,          score ≤ prev
+ all artifacts present      verifier_last_verdict=            → strict default:
                              MAX_REACHED_RETURN, allow          targeted escalation,
                                                                 NOT blocker
                                                                 blog mode:
                                                                 RALPH_CONVERGENCE_EXIT=1
                                                                 returns current output
```

### Sub-Agent Hierarchy

```
Orchestrator (GENERATOR) ──▶ Worker/Coder (GENERATOR) ──▶ Evidence
                │
                ▼
            CRITIC (tester, analyst, qa-verifier)
                │
                ▼
            JUDGE (verifier) ── HMAC-signed PASS
```

Workers do NOT self-assess. Orchestrator routes to JUDGE. Only JUDGE can stop the loop.
On verifier FAIL or evidence PRECHECK_FAIL, `ralph-loop-infinite-stop.sh` deterministically invokes `ralph-loop-infinite-generator.py`, which dispatches explicit `orchestrator,coder,tester` stages through `scripts/ralph-spawn.sh` (configurable via `RALPH_GENERATOR_ROLES`). Success requires every required stage to exit 0 and write an evidence artifact. The Stop hook monitors and records state; the generator subprocess is the autonomous executor backend.

> **Verifier architecture note:** The JUDGE is **not** spawned as a separate sub-agent process. Instead, `ralph-loop-infinite-verifier.sh` calls `ralph-loop-infinite-ralph.py judge`, which runs the `critique_and_judge()` Python function — making two API calls (CRITIC, then JUDGE) with separate system prompts, parsing structured JSON responses, and enforcing the scoring contract in code. The HMAC signing happens in the shell after the Python judge returns. The `sub-agents/verifier/` directory and `verifier.SOUL.md` contain the JUDGE role contract used by the prompts, not an independently running agent.

## Regression Test

```bash
bash ~/.claude/hooks/test-ralph-refactor.sh
```

Expected: **PASS 26 / FAIL 0**

Tests enforce:
- Threshold ≥ 0.80 on all five dimensions
- Targeted fix remediation (not naive rewrite)
- Non-silent provider fallback
- Content-aware evidence validation
- Status-token regex enforcement
- DB-first signed-PASS lookup
- Anti-weak-criticism rules
- Anti-leniency rules

---

## Key Properties

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Threshold | 0.80 per dimension |
| MAX_ITERATIONS | 3 (hard blocker) |
| PASS TTL | 120 seconds |
| State DB | SQLite at `~/.claude/state/ralph-loop-infinite.db` |
| HMAC key | `~/.claude/secrets/ralph-hmac.key` |
| Manifest | `~/.claude/manifest/contract-hashes.json` |
| Verifier model | `claude-opus-4-7` (primary) / `MiniMax-M2.7` (fallback) |

The Ralph Loop forces the shift:

```
single-pass answers    →  iterative reasoning
implicit behavior      →  explicit evaluation
hopeful outputs        →  measured decisions
```
